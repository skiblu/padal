**Who is a Narikela swamy? What he has to do?**\
Those who wear mala for 18th time is called as Narikela Swamy. This swamy has to plant a coconut tree in Sabarimala during his sabari yatra. This is the tradition. Another dimension is that the 18 steps are considered as the 18 hindrances between us and the swamy, each year as we do sabari yatra by taking deeksha and visiting swamy, we cross each hindrance or rather remove that hindrance quality from us. By the 18th year we are crossing the 18th hindrance (usually considered as ego) or removing the last hindrance, so we become one with swamy or rather there are no more bad qualities left in us and we are pure so swamy sits in our heart and uses us as his instruments in making others realise swamy, so henceforth we are called guruswamy. A person who has thus realised swamy and can guide other swamy's taking deeksha. A coconut is a usually offered as purna phala when ever a yagna is performed, also offered in any diety puja. The breaking of coconut symbolises breaking of ego. The coconut also symbolises purity and is symbolically considered as ganesha.

So considering that right now I am becoming a complete fruit (purna phala), am offering myself at your lotus feet, just like a coconut is offered in a yagna, hence forth there are no traces of ego and any other bad qualities left in me, I am just like the camphor which has burnt and left no traces, showing light to many people. I am right now an instrument in your divine hands and work according to your divine plan my lord. This entire process symbolises the "Tatwamasi" written in the sanctum sanctorium of Sabarimala. With this sense the 18th year narikela swamy plants a coconut tree at sabarimala.

**Keralites / Malayalies** think  coconut tree as KALPAVRUKSHAM (Wish Fulfilling Tree)  and  they pray the coconut trees.
